# Native DualityLM

`DualityLM` is the first trainable decoder-only model in this repository. It
keeps the original DRAI V1 integration intact for augmenting pretrained
Hugging Face models, while adding a native architecture that can be trained
from an explicit configuration.

## What is new

Each selected decoder block contains:

1. pre-normalized causal self-attention;
2. a bounded attractor cloud with configurable slots;
3. a gated memory residual read from that cloud; and
4. a gated feed-forward sublayer.

The memory state is explicit rather than hidden in module parameters. A call
returns the next state, and a later call can pass it back alongside the
attention KV cache. This supports both teacher-forced training and
prompt-prefill plus token-by-token generation.

The state update is detached from autograd. That gives the model a recurrent
working-memory signal without retaining an unbounded computation graph across
an entire conversation. The query and read projections, along with the
influence gate, remain trainable.

## Quickstart

Install the project with its development dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the native smoke example:

```bash
python examples/duality_lm_toy.py
```

The example prints the logits shape, active-memory statistics, and a short
untrained greedy generation. Random output is expected until the model has
been trained.

## Minimal API

```python
import torch

from duality_lm import ByteTokenizer, DualityLM, DualityLMConfig

tokenizer = ByteTokenizer()
config = DualityLMConfig.tiny(vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size)
model = DualityLM(config)

prompt = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode("Duality remembers")])
output = model(prompt, use_cache=True)

next_output = model(
    torch.tensor([[tokenizer.eos_token_id]]),
    memory_state=output.memory_state,
    past_key_values=output.past_key_values,
    use_cache=True,
)

generated = model.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=32, do_sample=False)
print(tokenizer.decode(generated[0].tolist()))
```

For a plain-text bootstrap corpus, use:

```bash
python scripts/train_duality_lm.py \
  --text-file corpus.txt \
  --steps 500 \
  --output checkpoints/duality_lm.pt
```

The default model is deliberately a CPU-friendly starting point. Increase
`d_model`, `n_layers`, `n_heads`, `max_seq_len`, and the corpus size for a
serious experiment. The byte tokenizer is dependency-free and robust, but a
larger run should eventually replace it with a learned subword tokenizer.

## Memory placement and diagnostics

By default, memory is attached to the middle transformer block:

```python
config = DualityLMConfig.small(
    vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size,
    memory_layers=(2, 3),
)
```

Set `memory_layers=()` to build the same parameterized decoder without the
memory pathway for a baseline or ablation run.

After a forward pass:

```python
print(model.memory_stats(output.memory_state))
```

The diagnostics expose active slots, total strength, mean strength, and the
number of tokens processed by each memory-enabled block. These values are
observability signals, not a claim that the model has human-like memory or
reasoning.

## Scope of this milestone

This is a trainable research foundation, not a competitive pretrained LLM.
The repository still needs a curated corpus, tokenizer training, longer
training runs, evaluation against a baseline of the same parameter count, and
ablation studies that compare memory-enabled and memory-disabled models.
