# DRAI: Dynamic Resonance AI

**DRAI introduces persistent internal state into transformer models using a lightweight, fully differentiable mechanism based on attractor dynamics.**  
The goal is practical: improve stability, coherence, and short-term memory during inference without modifying pre-training, without external memory systems, and without non-standard operations.

Everything demonstrated here is reproducible, measurable, and implemented entirely with standard PyTorch and transformer components.

---

## Why This Exists

Modern transformers handle “memory” by repeatedly recomputing or externally retrieving context:

- **Context windows:** brute-force, quadratic compute  
- **RAG:** external documents, external orchestration  
- **Agent frameworks:** Python-level simulation of working memory  
- **Chain-of-thought:** text-based scaffolding, not internal state  

All of these operate *outside* the model.  
A transformer itself has **no persistent internal state** across forward passes.

**DRAI fills that gap.**

---

## Overview

DRAI introduces a small, persistent attractor field inside the model.  
This field is interpreted by specific attention heads at chosen layers, producing a structured, evolving “cloud” of state that:

- persists across tokens  
- conditions future computation  
- supports lightweight working-memory behaviour  
- adds <1% compute overhead  

The mechanism is dynamic, but the implementation is simple: a static vector, a projection step, and a controlled influence path into existing attention circuitry.

---

## Quick Example

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from src.drai import apply_drai_v1, get_v1_conservative_config

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/pythia-410m")

# Add internal state
config = get_v1_conservative_config()
model = apply_drai_v1(model, config=config)

# Use normally
outputs = model.generate(inputs)
```

No training.  
No fine-tuning.  
Your model now carries persistent internal state during inference.

## What You Get

DRAI enables several measurable computational primitives:

- **Persistent state across tokens**  
- **Self-conditioning** across layers  
- **Compositional binding** inside the residual stream  
- **Goal and context persistence** without external memory  
- **Stable multi-step reasoning at small scales**

These emerge from standard transformer operations, not architectural hacks.

---

## Results

**Story Comprehension (Pythia-410M)**  
- Baseline: **85.0%** (51/60)  
- DRAI V1: **88.3%** (53/60)  
- Improvement: **+3.3 points**  
- Overhead: **<1% latency**, ~10MB extra per layer

This task is intentionally simple — the point is demonstrating that persistent internal state produces consistent, reproducible gains even on small models.

## Reproduce in 5–10 Minutes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HalcyonAIR/Duality.git
cd Duality
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash scripts/run_reproduction_410m.sh
```

Runs on CPU.

## How It Works

### 1. The Attractor Field (Seed)
A small, persistent vector is injected at a designated layer.  
Its job is not to store information directly — it provides a stable reference frame.

### 2. Head-Specific Interpretation (Cascade)
Different attention heads interpret the field differently:

- head 1 → lexical cues  
- head 12 → syntactic structure  
- head 28 → semantic relations  
- head 45 → task context  
*(actual mappings vary by model, this is representative)*

The diversity of interpretations produces a rich, multi-dimensional internal state.

### 3. The Cloud (State)
Across layers, these interpretations accumulate into a **dynamic attractor cloud** inside the residual stream.

This cloud:  
- persists across tokens  
- shapes the next-step computation  
- adapts as the sequence unfolds  

The static field is the anchor; the cloud is the working memory.

## Mathematics (Intuition Only)

A simplified formulation:

```
F(q; M_A) = θ(‖S‖) · π_M_A(q̂)
```

Where:

- **π_M_A** — soft projection onto an attractor manifold  
- **θ** — burn-in / gating function  
- **M_A** — evolving attractor state  

For the full derivation, see:  
`docs/DRAI_V1_INVARIANT.md`

## Configurations

### Conservative (recommended for 400M–1B)

```python
config = get_v1_conservative_config()
```

- max_attractors: 16  
- max_influence_scale: 0.15  
- burn_in_threshold: 50 tokens  
- layer_mode: "mid"

### Standard (recommended for 7B+)

```python
from src.drai import get_v1_standard_config
config = get_v1_standard_config()
```

- max_attractors: 64  
- max_influence_scale: 0.5  
- multi-layer integration

See `src/drai/config.py` for details.

## FAQ

**How is this different from RAG?**  
RAG is external memory. DRAI is internal state.

**How is this different from long context windows?**  
Long context recomputes everything. DRAI maintains an evolving internal state.

**Does this work with fine-tuned models?**  
Yes — it is fully post-hoc.

**Does this require retraining?**  
No. It attaches cleanly to pretrained models.

**Is this a cognitive architecture?**  
No. This project focuses strictly on engineering persistent internal state.
